Do later maybe if it becomes an issue
{
	Everything is using render queue 0
	Need to assign proper renderQueue - Potentially fix issue where renderqueue 1 doesn't work

	RenderQueues

	0 : Background
	1 : Effects | Spell effects bg
	2 : Normal  | Enemies, spells
	3 : Effects & Overlays bg | Spell effects fg, menu bg
	4 : Overlays fg | SpellScroll
	5 : Buttons & text | Buttons, menu icons, text
}

Add cooldown to spell !!!!!!!!!!!! NEED ANIMATION FIRST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	State : 0 -> Ready
			1 -> Charging
			2 -> launching;
	If state != 0, can't cast

Collisions
	Rect

Enemies :
	Leve
	Wave has :
			UpdateFunc
			spawn func
			isOver check
			Cleanup Func


Maybe animator shouldn't display sprites.
It should modify their data to match the animation
But need SDLX to be able to display sprites (or user)

Perhaps a better to render sprites would be to have an array, and a constant static sprites (static sprites stay & dynamic sprites are added
to the array after them.)
Static sprites are UI elements, background sprites , etc ?
